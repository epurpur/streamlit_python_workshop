### Intro to Streamlit

In this workshop we will build some simple web apps and/or data dashboards with [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/). Streamlit is an open-source python library used for creating web applications for data related purposes including simply displaying your data, data science, and machine learning projects. It is designed to make it easy for programmers to turn data related projects into shareable web applications without requiring extensive web development experience. Streamlit allows you to build interactive data dashboards and visualizations quickly and easiy. 

### Let's Get Started

[Here is a quick example of what these dashboards look like](https://blog.streamlit.io/how-to-build-a-real-time-live-dashboard-with-streamlit/).

Streamlit has a ["Get Started"](https://docs.streamlit.io/library/get-started) page in their documentation that we will be following today for this workshop.
